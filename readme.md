# **Sentiment Analysis for Stock Prediction through Named Entity Recognition**

This project investigates the relationship between U.S. presidential tweets and their effect on the financial market. By leveraging Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis, we aim to determine whether tweets mentioning financial entities can predict short-term market movements.

### **Instructions for replicating investigation results:**

To run the baseline, navigate to the baseline folder and compile the baseline.py file which will save the model weights locally. The model can then be loaded in the testbaseline.ipynb file where it can be assessed on the test data.

To run our custom model, follow and run the trainingmodel.ipynb file which will also save the model weights locally. With testing.ipynb you can load the model and run test metrics. Our (labelled) test data is available at combined_labels.csv.
