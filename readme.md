Baseline:

basically just conver the train /dev data provided into format to be run by model.
Every group will use the same data.
Recommended to import more domain-specific NER models from platforms like huggingface, e.g. FinBERT (https://huggingface.co/FinanceInc/finbert-pretrain)

To-do:
- actually run the baseline on some platform (HPC (??))
